Welcome to Rust Start! This repository serves as a foundational guide and reference for understanding key Rust concepts related to variables, mutability, immutability, constants, and scopes.

## Overview

This project is structured to provide clear examples and explanations of fundamental Rust concepts. By exploring the codebase, you'll gain insights into Rust's approach to managing data, memory, and variable usage.

### Concepts Covered

- **Variables:** Understanding variable declaration, initialization, and their types in Rust.
- **Mutability and Immutability:** Differentiating between mutable and immutable variables, and their impact on program behavior.
- **Constants:** Exploring Rust's constants and their usage compared to variables.
- **Scopes - Interior & Exterior:** Examining how Rust manages variable scopes, distinguishing between inner and outer scopes.
